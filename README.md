*Programming in Java. Some of my projects with a descriptions*
---
**Program 1.**
```
Program, which reads an integer n and prints list of its aliquots (inclusively with 1 & n).
```
---
**Program 2.**
```
Program, which reads an integer n, generates n random integers within the range of [0,10), and then creates a histogram to visualize the data
```

**Program 3.- Life Game**
```
Life Game:

The game is played on a board with a size of nXn, divided into nXn square cells. Each cell has eight "neighbors," meaning cells adjacent to it by sides and corners. Each cell can be in one of two states: it can be either "alive" (on) or "dead" (off). The states of cells change at certain time units. The state of all cells in one time unit is used to calculate the state of all cells in the next unit. After calculation, all cells change their state exactly at the same moment. The state of a cell depends only on the number of its living neighbors.

Conway's Game Rules:

A dead cell with exactly 3 living neighbors becomes alive in the next time unit (it is born).
A living cell with 2 or 3 living neighbors remains alive; with any other number of neighbors, it dies (due to "loneliness" or "overcrowding").
Program simulate the game's state at successive moments in time. The board size, n, is provided as a program parameter. The initial state is generated randomly with 30% of cells initially alive. Subsequent states are displayed after pressing Enter.
